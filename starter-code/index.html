          <h2>Ideas for ship placement</h2>
          <p>Different sized ships (or islands) are displayed here.</p>
          <p>I need to find a way for the player to click the ship and add it to the grid.</p>
          <p>After adding it to the grid, they should be able to rotate it.</p>
          <p>I could add a class to the ship that makes it disappear from the box and appear on the grid.</p>
          <!-- <p>I could randomly select a spot for the player again and again until they're happy.</p>
          <p>But that's not as fun as choosing yourself.</p> -->
          <p>The player can move and rotate their ship with key strokes. (like how pikachu moved around)
          <p>But I'll need a way to "lock in" their decisions once they begin the game.<p>
          <h2>The computer's grid.</h2>
          <p>Or, they could click the grid to add the ships and a text input box takes a co-ordinate every turn for
            their guess.</p>
          <p>I'd need to take the co-ordinate, store it in a variable, and check that varible against the (unseen)
            computer's board.</p>
          <!-- like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17433557/how-to-save-user-input-into-a-variable-in-html-and-js -->
          <p>I could make the computer's board physically on the page, but give it a class that displays: none once I am
            done testing.</p>
